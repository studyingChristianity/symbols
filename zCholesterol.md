# Cholesterol

* **Cholesterol, total:** The overall amount of cholesterol in your blood, including HDL, LDL, and other lipid components.
* **HDL Cholesterol:** The “good” cholesterol that helps remove excess cholesterol from your arteries.
* **LDL Cholesterol:** The “bad” cholesterol that can build up in artery walls and increase heart disease risk.
* **Triglycerides:** A type of fat in the blood that rises with excess calories, sugar, or alcohol and can raise cardiovascular risk when high.
* **Non-HDL Cholesterol:** All the “bad” cholesterol combined (total cholesterol minus HDL), giving a fuller picture of artery-clogging particles.
