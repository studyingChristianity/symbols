<h3>HDL Cholesterol</h3>
The level of HDL cholesterol circulating in the blood can help determine your risk for heart disease. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) considers an HDL cholesterol level of less than 50 mg/dL in women 20 years of age and older to be a risk factor for heart disease. HDL cholesterol is considered the “good” cholesterol and a level equal to or above 60 mg/dL may reduce the risk of heart disease. Other cholesterol measurements, alongside patient characteristics, should be taken into consideration when determining a person’s risk level for heart disease and monitoring for therapy (lifestyle modifications or medication) responses.

<h3>Triglycerides</h3>
High blood levels of triglycerides may be caused by overweight/obesity, a diet very high in carbohydrates, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, and too much alcohol intake. A person may reduce their blood level of triglycerides by controlling their weight, being physically active, not smoking cigarettes, avoiding too much alcohol intake, and limiting their eating and drinking of simple sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages. Some medications may also be helpful to reduce triglyceride levels in the blood.
