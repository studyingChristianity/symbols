The idea that Christians “do not like to take medications” is actually more of a stereotype.

1. **Faith in Divine Healing**:
   Some Christians believe that God can heal sickness directly through prayer or divine intervention. They may prefer prayer, laying on of hands, or other spiritual practices over medications. This is particularly common in Pentecostal or Charismatic groups.

2. **Belief in Natural Remedies**:
   Certain Christians may view medications as “unnatural” and prefer remedies from herbs, diet, or lifestyle changes. They may believe that God intended natural methods for health and healing.

3. **Distrust of Modern Medicine**:
   Some Christians, especially in more conservative or fundamentalist circles, may be skeptical of medical institutions or pharmaceuticals, fearing side effects, over-medication, or profit motives of the pharmaceutical industry.

4. **Theological Beliefs About Suffering**:
   Some may interpret suffering as spiritually meaningful, believing that enduring illness can strengthen faith or serve a higher purpose, and might therefore minimize medical intervention unless absolutely necessary.

5. **Specific Denominational Teachings**:
   For example, certain groups like Christian Scientists are officially taught to rely on prayer rather than medicine, though this is a minority position within Christianity.

### 🔍 [The fallout of Epstein’s crimes spans the globe. Here’s a look at some of those paying the cost](https://apnews.com/article/cb9ea7854da0582f7f5ddb2efd5fca6a?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

* More than **1,000 Epstein victims** remain central to ongoing fallout.
* **Donald Trump** signed a bill forcing the DOJ to release many Epstein files — a reversal given his earlier resistance.
* In one email, Epstein claimed Trump “knew about the girls,” though it remains unclear exactly what Trump allegedly knew.
* The White House disputes the narrative, calling the email release a political “smear.”
* **Lawrence Summers** (economist / former Treasury Secretary) stayed in touch with Epstein until at least 2019, including seeking personal advice.
* Due to the revelations, Summers has stepped away from several roles (e.g., OpenAI, think tanks) and is under review by Harvard.
* **Harvard University** is reopening its investigation into Epstein’s ties to the institution.
* **Prince Andrew** (now Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor) was stripped of royal titles and evicted from his residence after links to Epstein resurfaced, including testimony from a victim.
* Public trust is eroding: Epstein’s network included royalty, academics, political figures, and institutions — showing the deep and long-lasting influence he maintained.
* The article underscores how Epstein’s crimes continue to have global repercussions, even years after his death.

## 🐖 Richard Nixon's Desire to Avoid Personal and Political Embarrassment

After the break-in, Nixon’s main motive became covering it up, not because he ordered it (there’s no evidence he did), but because he feared:

* scandal
* the fall of his senior aides
* political humiliation
* damage to his presidency

🐽 As often happens, the cover-up became worse than the crime.

## How are people changing their identities?

### 1. **Digital Identity**

* **Online personas:** Many people adopt new names, avatars, or even AI-generated faces for privacy or creative expression.
* **Social media reinvention:** Platforms let people curate or reframe who they are — sometimes drastically — by changing content, communities, and aesthetics.
* **Virtual worlds and the metaverse:** Avatars in games or VR spaces allow people to explore gender, appearance, and social roles more freely.

### 2. **Social & Cultural Identity**

* **Gender and sexuality:** More people are exploring and affirming gender or sexual identities that align with their inner selves — including through social transition, name/pronoun changes, and sometimes medical steps.
* **Cultural fluidity:** Globalization and migration have made identity more hybrid — people blend cultural traditions, languages, and aesthetics in new ways.
* **Political and ideological shifts:** People increasingly adopt or shed political and religious identities based on personal values or social experiences.

### 3. **Legal Identity**

* **Name and gender marker changes:** Many countries now have legal pathways to update documents to match someone’s lived identity.
* **Nationality or citizenship:** Some change legal identity through immigration, dual citizenship, or new national affiliations.

### 4. **Technological & Biological Frontiers**

* **Biohacking and augmentation:** Some experiment with implants, gene editing, or digital enhancements that alter bodily or cognitive identity.
* **AI and deepfakes:** Digital tools can convincingly replicate or transform faces and voices, creating questions about what “identity” even means online.

## Anonymous Tip #2

**Subject:** Anonymous Tip Regarding Possible Fraudulent Activities at Local Convenience Store

**Message:**

I would like to report some activities that I believe may be suspicious or potentially fraudulent at a neighborhood convenience store.

On two separate occasions:

My credit card was unexpectedly declined at the store, even though it works normally elsewhere.

During another visit, the cashier gave me incorrect change, which raised further concern about possible dishonest or fraudulent activity.

I am not making any accusations, but I thought it was important to bring these incidents to your attention in case there is a larger issue occurring at this location.

## United Healthcare is a criminal enterprise.

Brian Thompson, the 50-year-old CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot on December 4, 2024, outside the Hilton Midtown hotel in New York City while arriving for a company investor conference. The suspect, 26-year-old Luigi Mangione from Maryland, was later arrested and charged with murder and weapons offenses, with investigators suggesting the attack was driven by anger toward the health-insurance industry rather than a personal motive. Thompson’s death shocked the corporate and healthcare worlds, sparking debates about public frustration with the U.S. insurance system and the safety of high-profile executives.

## Money laundering:

is the process of illegally concealing the origin of money obtained from illicit activities, such as drug trafficking, corruption, and embezzlement, and converting it into a seemingly legitimate source. In simple terms, it involves taking "dirty money" and making it appear as if it was earned legitimately. This process is often used by criminal enterprises to hide their funds and is subject to various legal offenses designed to prevent and prosecute such activities.

### 📝 An anonymous crime tip was submitted to the San Jose Police Department around Nov 4, 2025 at 10:15 pm on the iPhone app, P3 Tips

**Subject:** Suspicious Activity – Possible Illegal Cannabis Cultivation

**Description:**
I have observed a suspicious activity at this residence over the past few weeks. Specifically, bright lights in the backyard turn on and off at irregular intervals at night, roughly every 10 to 60 seconds. This raises concerns that there may be illegal outdoor cannabis cultivation occurring.

NOTE: A video of the lights turning on and off was attached.

---

> [!NOTE]
> I noticed today that:
> 1) there's a strong smell coming from my neighbor
> 2) they have lights in the backyard at night (white, irregularly turning on/off every 15, 65, 10, etc. seconds)

---

## Growing Cannabis in California

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **“The cultivation of cannabis outdoors is prohibited within the City of San Jose.” according to the San Jose Municipal Code, Chapter 6.88.430 D.**<br/>
> If you live in San Jose, California, and you suspect your neighbor may be illegally growing cannabis (for example, growing outdoors or operating a large, unlicensed grow), you have several proper and confidential ways to report it — depending on the situation.
> #### 🚨 San Jose Police Department (SJPD) – Non-Emergency Line
> Use this if you suspect illegal activity, but it’s not an immediate emergency (e.g., no fire, violence, or active danger).<br/>
> 📞 (408) 277-8900 – SJPD non-emergency number<br/>
> You can also file a tip online at:<br/>
> 👉 https://www.sjpd.org/report-a-crime<br/>
> If you ever believe there’s immediate danger (fire hazard, electrical issues, or threats), call 911.

In some cases, people use powerful grow lights to cultivate marijuana illegally. Indicators might include:

* <ins>Very bright light visible at odd hours (especially at night)</ins>
* Curtains always closed or covered windows
* Unusual smells (strong, skunky odor)
* Humming or buzzing sounds from fans or ventilation equipment

### ✅ What’s Legal

* **Age:** You must be **21 or older**.
* **Number of plants:** You can grow **up to six (6) cannabis plants per household**, **not per person**.
* **Location:** Plants must be **grown at your private residence** — either indoors or outdoors, **in a secure and enclosed area**.
* **Visibility:** The plants **cannot be visible to the public** (for example, from a street, sidewalk, or neighboring yard).
* **Security:** They must be **locked or otherwise secured** to prevent access by minors or others.

### ⚠️ Local Rules

Cities and counties can add their own restrictions — for example:

* Some allow only **indoor grows**.
* Others require permits or **ban outdoor cultivation entirely**.
  So, it’s important to check **your local city or county ordinances** (e.g., Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento, etc.) because enforcement and rules differ widely.

### 🚫 What’s Illegal

* Growing **more than six plants**.
* Selling cannabis without a state license.
* Growing in a location where **it’s visible to the public**.
* Allowing minors access to the plants.

Gods' race is still ongoing. [Technologies, Decentralized] v.s. [Nature, Centralized].

In the end, drug addicts are that way because of their DNAs.

### 👁️ Enforcement and public-health strategies focus on disrupting networks, not just arresting street-level users

### 🫆 Why don’t the illegal drug makers get caught, and why don’t their drug-making activities stop?"

- **Drug production is highly attractive and resilient:** <ins>Big profits</ins>, vast resources, and persistent demand
- **Drug production is decentralized:** Small-batch labs, quickly adapt methods and chemicals when one route is blocked
- **The chemicals used have legitimate uses:** Moved through complex international supply chains, making detection difficult
- **Uncoordinated law enforcement:** Limited capacity, corruption, encrypted technology, and legal hurdles

### 🍷 Where are the illegal drugs sold and how?

> [!CAUTION]
> - There are **wholesale** and **retail** sales.
> - Illegal drug activities **adapt to law enforcement**: encrypted communications, delivery disguises, small-batch shipments

- Music x dancing x alcohol x performances: Clubs, bars, music festivals, after-parties, private clubs
- Hiding small quantities to avoid detection by security or police: 
- Online: Dark web
- Social media, messaging apps, apps, websites, forums: Local sales (centered around an individual)
- Shipping: Via postal systems (UPS, FedEx, DHL, USPS)
- Smuggling (large-scale trafficking): Via ports, airports, border crossings

### 📻 News: Christians are killed in Nigeria
https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/nigeria-responds-to-trump-s-warning-of-christian-mass-slaughter/ar-AA1PBOwV?ocid=msedgdhp&pc=U531&cvid=6906b13b9d3040a18db7e55672c34edd&ei=12

<p>Nigeria said it was committed to tackling violent extremism, but dismissed any suggestion of genocide in Africa’s most populous nation after U.S. President Donald Trump said thousands of Christians were being killed in a “mass slaughter” by radical Islamists and Christianity faces an existential threat there.</p>

<p>“For the avoidance of any doubt, and out of respect for all the victims and survivors around the world of this unique and appalling crime against humanity, let the record show that there is no genocide, now or ever, in Nigeria,” Yusuf Maitama Tuggar, Minister of Foreign Affairs, said in a message to Newsweek.</p>

<p>Why it Matters: Nigeria is Africa’s heavyweight with a population of around 240 million people and has long rejected suggestions by some U.S. evangelical Christian groups and politicians that killings of Christians are a deliberate campaign of extermination rather than being part of ongoing violence by Islamist radicals and bandits who also routinely kill Muslims in the West African nation.</p>

"Hi, I’m calling because there’s a very strong, distinct smell coming
from my neighbor’s house. I think something is wrong or someone
is dead."

"I first noticed it yesterday, and it’s getting worse."
