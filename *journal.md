#### <ins>ナルシ族 = Those who believe they are gods or who believe in a god</ins>

#### <ins>NOTE: The majoirity of ナルシ族 are Christians</ins>

### 🚨Illega drug sales🚨

- Illicit resale of prescription drugs (Opioid marketing = Make you feel pain via the air)
- Exploiting regulatory loopholes - Sold online as "not for human consumption" or "for research purposes only"

### ☄️New Christians☄️

Transformations:
1) drug-making activities (public health issues)
2) dead bodies (public health issues)
3) Christian candles (public health issues)
4) opioid/fentanyl (pain killer > comfort > safety > pleasure > Missionary)
5) alcohol (causes you a cognitive decline)

### 🚨Old Christians🚨
Christians in the South of the United States (the last indigenous
people in the world) openly discriminated and killed the minorities.
They are still keeping dead bodies in their residence.

The trend in the society has been that people like their ego to
be boosted. Call them Gods. They are also called ナルシ族
as a group.

Gods' race is happening.

"Hi, I’m calling because there’s a very strong, distinct smell coming
from my neighbor’s house. I think something is wrong or someone
is dead."

"I first noticed it yesterday, and it’s getting worse."

### 🚨 The Missionary Period started everywhere.

The Christians are moving and performing their rituals. They:

- Drink alcohol and take opioid
- Burn Christian candles inside. The oddor disrupts their neighbors
- Make illega drugs

✅ I threw salt at the fence by the Christians. I put a bowl of cooking
sake in the middle of the backyard. I sprayed isopropyl alcohol in the
backyard.
