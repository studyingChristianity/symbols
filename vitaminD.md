Here’s a list of foods that are naturally rich in **vitamin D** or commonly fortified with it:

### 🐟 **Fatty Fish (Best Natural Sources)**

These are among the richest natural sources of vitamin D:

* Salmon (especially wild-caught)
* Mackerel
* Sardines
* Tuna
* Trout
* Herring
* Cod liver oil (extremely high in vitamin D)

### 🍳 **Animal-Based Sources**

* Egg yolks (from pasture-raised chickens have higher vitamin D)
* Beef liver

### 🧈 **Fortified Foods**

Many foods are fortified with vitamin D to help people meet daily needs:

* Fortified cow’s milk
* Fortified plant-based milks (soy, almond, oat, etc.)
* Fortified breakfast cereals
* Fortified orange juice
* Fortified yogurt and margarine

💡 **Tip:**
The **recommended daily intake** for adults is about **600–800 IU (15–20 µg)**, though some people (especially those with limited sun exposure) may need more.

Would you like me to make a **meal plan** or **shopping list** focused on boosting your vitamin D intake?
