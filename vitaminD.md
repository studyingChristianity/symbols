<h1>Vitamin D</h1>

Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin _essential for maintaining healthy bones, teeth, and muscles_ by aiding calcium and phosphorus absorption.

Two main forms:

* Vitamin Dâ‚‚ (ergocalciferol): Found in some plants and mushrooms
* vitamin Dâ‚ƒ (cholecalciferol): Produced in the skin through sunlight exposure and found in animal-based foods.

Deficiency in vitamin D can lead to weakened bones, fatigue, and increased risk of osteoporosis, rickets, and certain immune disorders. Beyond bone health, vitamin D supports immune function, mood regulation, and may play a role in reducing inflammation and chronic disease risk.

Because few foods naturally contain it, many people rely on sunlight exposure, fortified foods, or supplements to meet daily requirements.
