Here’s a clear overview of how **advanced and educated people in the United States are today about cross-religious conversations** and understanding religions other than their own:

---

## 📊 **1. General Religious Knowledge in the U.S. Is Limited**

A major national study by the Pew Research Center asked U.S. adults 32 fact-based questions about religion (including Christianity, Islam, Judaism, Hinduism, Buddhism and other topics):

* On average, **Americans correctly answered fewer than half the questions (~14 out of 32)**. ([Pew Research Center][1])
* Only **about 9% got more than three-quarters of the questions right** and **less than 1% got a perfect score.** ([Pew Research Center][2])
* Americans tend to do much **better on basic questions about Christianity and the Bible** than on other world religions. ([Pew Research Center][1])
* On non-Christian religions, **knowledge drops sharply**: only about 3 in 10 know when the Jewish Sabbath begins, and very few can identify foundational concepts in Buddhism and Hinduism. ([The Foundation for Religious Literacy][3])

**What this suggests:** Many Americans lack broad factual knowledge about a range of religious traditions — a basic form of literacy that supports meaningful cross-religious conversations.

---

## 🗣 **2. Education Helps — But It’s Not Universal**

Factors linked with higher religious knowledge include:

* **Higher education and taking world religions classes** — college grads do significantly better on religious knowledge measures than those with only a high school diploma. ([Pew Research Center][4])
* **Having a religiously diverse social circle** — people who personally know friends of many different religious backgrounds score higher on knowledge questions. ([Pew Research Center][4])

Still, these educated subgroups are a minority — meaning that **well-informed, nuanced understanding of multiple religions is far from the norm** for the average American.

---

## 🤝 **3. Attitudes About & Engagement with Religious Diversity**

While factual knowledge may be limited, **many Americans are open to and do engage cross-religiously on a personal level**:

* A study shared by Interfaith America reported that **about 72% of Americans have built a relationship with someone of a different religion** (coworker, neighbor, classmate). ([Interfaith America][5])
* Most say being part of a **religiously diverse nation is a source of pride**. ([Interfaith America][5])

This suggests that even if detailed theological literacy is low, **real-world exposure to religious difference is fairly common**.

---

## 🎓 **4. Interfaith Education & Dialogue Efforts Are Growing**

There are growing efforts — especially in education and civic organizations — to improve interfaith understanding and conversation skills:

* **Programs and toolkits** aim to build “interfaith literacy,” teaching how to understand and talk respectfully across religious differences. ([Interfaith America][6])
* Initiatives like **Interfaith Youth Core’s IDEALS research** track how college students are prepared (or not) for religious diversity and inter-religious engagement. ([Interfaith America][7])
* Foundations and media projects increasingly fund **religious literacy and multi-faith dialogue content** to reach broader audiences. ([AVDF][8])

However, **this specialized education is not yet a mainstream part of the general curriculum** outside certain campuses or communities.

---

## 🧠 **5. What This Means for Cross-Religious Conversations**

### **Strengths**

✔ Many Americans encounter diverse religions through personal relationships. ([Interfaith America][5])
✔ There is broad support for diversity and pluralism. ([Interfaith America][5])
✔ Educated and diverse social networks correlate with more knowledge. ([Pew Research Center][4])

### **Challenges**

⚠ Many Americans lack even basic factual knowledge about religions outside their own. ([Pew Research Center][1])
⚠ Advanced theological or interfaith literacy — the kind that supports deep dialogue — is limited mostly to specialists, students, religious leaders, or those proactively seeking it out.

---

## 🧩 **Overall Summary**

**Americans today are generally open to religious diversity and many form cross-faith relationships.** But **broad educational grounding in multiple religions is limited** — most people know basics about their own faith and some about Christianity, but struggle with understanding other traditions beyond surface level. Targeted interfaith education and dialogue programs are growing but not yet widespread enough to make the general population highly educated about cross-religious discourse.

Making new friends at 40 in 2026 is actually easier than it was five years ago because the "loneliness epidemic" has become so well-recognized that many new systems have been built specifically to solve it.

The secret in 2026 is moving away from "networking" and moving toward **"repeated unplanned interactions."** Here is the current roadmap for building a new social circle.

### 1. Use the "Third Place" Apps

In 2026, several apps have moved beyond the "swiping" model and focused on group-based, real-world activities:

* **Timeleft:** This is huge right now. It signs you up for a dinner with five strangers at a local restaurant based on a personality quiz. It’s designed specifically to remove the "who do I talk to?" awkwardness.
* **Bumble For Friends (BFF):** Now a standalone app, it’s the standard for 1-on-1 friend "dating." Pro-tip: Look for people who mention "activity-based" hangouts (hiking, gaming, coffee).
* **Meetup:** Still the king for niche interests. In 2026, look for "Beginner" groups (Pottery, Pickleball, or Language Learning). Everyone there is equally bad at the hobby, which is a great bonding agent.
