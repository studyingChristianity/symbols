<h1>What is the mechanism of opioid making people feel comfort?</h1>


<h2>1. Opioids bind to μ-opioid receptors (MORs)</h2>

These receptors are part of the body’s endogenous opioid system, which naturally helps regulate pain, stress, and reward.

They’re found in the brain, spinal cord, and gut — especially dense in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens, regions central to reward and motivation.

<h2>2. Inhibition of GABAergic neurons</h2>

Normally, _GABA_ neurons in the VTA _inhibit dopamine release_.

When _opioids_ bind to MORs on these GABA neurons, they suppress GABA activity, which _removes this inhibition_ — a process called disinhibition.

<h2>3. Increased dopamine release</h2>

With GABA “brakes” lifted, dopamine floods the nucleus accumbens.

This dopamine surge produces feelings of pleasure, safety, and comfort — part of the “reward” sensation.

<h2>4. Effects on the limbic system and brainstem</h2>

In the amygdala and periaqueductal gray, opioids reduce the perception of pain and stress.

In the hypothalamus, they can induce a sense of warmth and calm.

The locus coeruleus, involved in arousal and anxiety, is dampened — further enhancing relaxation.

<h2>5. Endogenous opioids mimic this naturally</h2>

Your body makes its own opioids (endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins).

Exercise, social bonding, laughter, or even comforting touch can activate the same pathways — but in a controlled, healthy way.

So, that feeling of “comfort” is really the nervous system’s reward and pain-relief machinery being pushed to an extreme.
