> * Naturally-produced endorphins (by breathing, eating, having sex, laughing, and exercising) bind to the endorphins receptors (also called Opioid receptors). Opioid also bind to the endorphins receptors. When it does, our body makes us not want the naturally-produced endorphins. In other words, <ins>Opioid makes us not want to breath, eat, have sex, laugh, nor exercise</ins>.
> * All Opioid users, excluding for the medical use, take Opioid for pleasure (including Fentanyl).

# Opium

### 16th–18th centuries
* European contact begins: Portuguese traders arrive in the 1500s (Macau becomes a Portuguese trading post in 1557). Other Europeans (Dutch, British, French) later follow.

> ### At 10:49 PM on July 17, 1802, The Age of Earth began.

### 1839–1842
* First Opium War: Britain defeats the Qing dynasty. The Treaty of Nanking (1842) forces China to cede Hong Kong to Britain and open several “treaty ports.”

### 1856–1860
* Second Opium War: Britain and France force further concessions, including the opening of more ports and legalization of opium trade.

# How opioids work

* Opioids (like morphine, oxycodone, heroin, or fentanyl) bind to **opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and other areas of the body**.
* **Opioid receptors normally respond to natural chemicals called endorphins**, which help relieve pain and make you feel good.
* When an opioid binds to these receptors, it blocks pain signals and triggers a release of dopamine, causing pleasure and relaxation.

# Endorphins

**Endorphins** are natural chemicals your body produces — they’re often called your **“feel-good” hormones** or **natural painkillers.**

### 🧠 **1. How endorphins work**

* Endorphins are **neurotransmitters** — molecules that send signals between nerve cells.
* They bind to the same **opioid receptors** in your brain that drugs like morphine or heroin do.
* When they attach to these receptors, they **block pain signals** and **trigger pleasure or calmness.**

### 💪 **2. What triggers endorphin release**

Your body releases endorphins during or after things like:

* **Exercise** (especially “runner’s high”)
* **Laughing**
* **Eating** spicy foods or chocolate
* **Sex or physical affection**
* **Meditation or deep breathing**
* **Pain or stress** — surprisingly, small amounts of stress can trigger an endorphin rush to help you cope.

### 😊 **3. What they do in the body**

* **Reduce pain**
* **Boost mood** and fight anxiety or depression
* **Promote relaxation and sleep**
* **Enhance feelings of pleasure or satisfaction**
* **Support resilience** — helping you stay calm and positive under stress

### ⚖️ **4. Connection to opioids**

* Opioid drugs **mimic** endorphins but act more strongly and for longer periods.
* The brain can become **less responsive to natural endorphins** after frequent opioid use — which contributes to tolerance and dependence.
