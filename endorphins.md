# How opioids work

* Opioids (like morphine, oxycodone, heroin, or fentanyl) bind to **opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and other areas of the body**.
* **Opioid receptors normally respond to natural chemicals called endorphins**, which help relieve pain and make you feel good.
* When an opioid binds to these receptors, it blocks pain signals and triggers a release of dopamine, causing pleasure and relaxation.

# Endorphins

**Endorphins** are natural chemicals your body produces — they’re often called your **“feel-good” hormones** or **natural painkillers.**

### 🧠 **1. How endorphins work**

* Endorphins are **neurotransmitters** — molecules that send signals between nerve cells.
* They bind to the same **opioid receptors** in your brain that drugs like morphine or heroin do.
* When they attach to these receptors, they **block pain signals** and **trigger pleasure or calmness.**

### 💪 **2. What triggers endorphin release**

Your body releases endorphins during or after things like:

* **Exercise** (especially “runner’s high”)
* **Laughing**
* **Eating** spicy foods or chocolate
* **Sex or physical affection**
* **Meditation or deep breathing**
* **Pain or stress** — surprisingly, small amounts of stress can trigger an endorphin rush to help you cope.

### 😊 **3. What they do in the body**

* **Reduce pain**
* **Boost mood** and fight anxiety or depression
* **Promote relaxation and sleep**
* **Enhance feelings of pleasure or satisfaction**
* **Support resilience** — helping you stay calm and positive under stress

### ⚖️ **4. Connection to opioids**

* Opioid drugs **mimic** endorphins but act more strongly and for longer periods.
* The brain can become **less responsive to natural endorphins** after frequent opioid use — which contributes to tolerance and dependence.
