## What caffeine is (in one line)

**Caffeine is a natural stimulant** that mainly affects the **brain and nervous system**, making you feel more awake and alert.

---

## What caffeine does in your body

### 1. Blocks “sleep signals” in the brain 🧠

Your brain builds up a chemical called **adenosine** during the day.

* Adenosine = “you’re tired, slow down”
* Caffeine **blocks adenosine receptors**, so your brain *can’t feel* that tiredness.

Result: **alertness, less fatigue** (but the tiredness isn’t gone — it’s just masked).

---

### 2. Increases stimulating brain chemicals

Caffeine indirectly boosts:

* **Dopamine** → motivation, focus, mild pleasure
* **Norepinephrine** → alertness, reaction speed

This is why caffeine can improve **concentration and mood** short-term.

---

### 3. Stimulates the body (not just the brain)

Caffeine also:

* Raises **heart rate** slightly
* Increases **blood pressure** temporarily
* Signals the body to release **adrenaline**

That’s why some people feel **energized**, while others feel **jittery or anxious**.

---

### 4. Affects digestion and fluids

* Stimulates **stomach acid** → can irritate sensitive stomachs
* Mild **diuretic**, but regular users adapt (it doesn’t “dehydrate” you much)

---

## How long caffeine lasts ⏱️

* **Onset**: 15–30 minutes
* **Peak effect**: 1–2 hours
* **Half-life**: ~5–7 hours
  → Half of the caffeine you drink at 2 pm may still be in your body at 8–9 pm.

This is why afternoon caffeine can **hurt sleep** even if you “feel fine.”

---

## Benefits (when used wisely)

✔ Improved alertness & reaction time
✔ Better focus and short-term memory
✔ Improved physical performance
✔ May reduce risk of some diseases (coffee/tea studies)

---

## Downsides (especially with too much)

⚠️ Anxiety, restlessness
⚠️ Sleep disruption
⚠️ Stomach irritation
⚠️ Increased heart rate or palpitations
⚠️ Dependence → headaches & fatigue when skipped

---

## Tolerance & dependence

* Daily use → your brain **creates more adenosine receptors**
* Result: you need **more caffeine for the same effect**
* Skipping it suddenly can cause **withdrawal headaches**, fatigue, irritability

(Usually resolves in 2–7 days.)

---

## How much is “safe”?

* **Most adults**: up to **400 mg/day**
* **Sensitive people**: may feel effects at **50–100 mg**
* **Pregnancy**: usually advised **≤200 mg/day**

## Why switching to mostly tea often works well 🍵

### 1. Gentler caffeine = smoother energy

Coffee and Diet Coke hit fast. Tea tends to:

* have **less caffeine per serving**
* release it **more gradually**

Result: fewer jitters, less anxiety, fewer crashes.

*(Tea contains L-theanine, which smooths caffeine’s effect — coffee doesn’t.)*

### 2. Better sleep without trying

Even if you “feel fine” with afternoon coffee/soda, caffeine lingers.
With tea, many people notice:

* easier falling asleep
* deeper sleep
* less wired-at-night feeling

This alone can be life-changing.

### 3. Less acid, less stomach irritation

* Coffee → increases stomach acid
* Diet Coke → acidic + carbonated

Tea (especially green, oolong, rooibos) is usually **much easier on the gut**.

### 4. Extra health perks

Tea gives you:

* antioxidants (polyphenols)
* possible heart & metabolic benefits
* no sugar, no sweeteners, no carbonation
