[Bush dynasty quietly plots Republican Party comeback as Trump era comes to a close](https://www.newstarget.com/2025-11-22-bush-dynasty-plots-gop-comeback-trump-exit.html)
Here are the three key points from the article:

* George W. Bush and his political network are reportedly organizing quietly to reclaim control of the GOP once Donald Trump leaves office, aiming to revive pre-Trump (establishment) Republican influence. ([NewsTarget][1])
* A “shadow” network of Bush loyalists is said to be preparing for a 2028 presidential bid or other leadership roles — with Jonathan Bush (George W.’s cousin) potentially running for Maine governor in 2026 as a springboard. ([NewsTarget][1])
* Some insiders argue Trump’s foreign-policy decisions (especially toward Russia) have weakened his base, while recent polling reportedly shows Bush’s favorability slightly higher than Trump’s, creating an opening for a “Bush comeback.” ([NewsTarget][1])
