## Ideal Saliva / Oral pH

| Age Range        | ph Level                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| **Older adults** | 6.2 – 7.6 (may trend slightly acidic if dry mouth increases with age) |

## Nicotine Lozenge:

* Nicotine absorption is ph-dependent. A mouth absorbs nicotine best in a neutral or slightly alkaline environment.
* Many foods are acidic > lower the pH. Wait for 15 minutes to so that nicotine lozenge will work effectively.
* Residual foods and drinks in the mouth can block nicotine from contacting the mucosa properly.
