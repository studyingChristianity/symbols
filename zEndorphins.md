# 21st Century Opioid Crisis

**1. Prescription Opioid Boom (2000s)**

* Drug companies heavily promoted opioids (e.g., OxyContin) as safe for chronic pain.
* Prescriptions surged, misuse increased, and overdose deaths rose.

**2. Heroin Wave (Early 2010s)**

* As prescribing tightened, many dependent users moved to heroin, which was cheaper and widely available.

**3. Synthetic Opioids / Fentanyl Wave (Mid-2010s → Present)**

* Illicit fentanyl and analogues entered the drug supply, far more potent than heroin.
* Overdose deaths spiked sharply and remain at historic highs.
* Counterfeit pills containing fentanyl further accelerated fatalities.

**4. Public Health & Legal Responses**

* Governments expanded naloxone access, treatment programs, harm-reduction efforts, and sued major pharmaceutical companies.
* Scientific efforts expanded to treat pain without addictive opioids.

### **Changes After Some Opioids Moved from Schedule II → Schedule I**

*(Applies mainly to **fentanyl-related analogues**, not medical fentanyl.)*

**1. Stronger Criminal Penalties**

* Schedule I classification allows harsher charges for possession, trafficking, and manufacturing.
* Closes loopholes where chemists slightly altered fentanyl’s structure to evade regulation.

**2. Research Restrictions**

* Schedule I status makes clinical research harder due to security, licensing, and federal approvals.
* Some scientists argue this slows development of better treatments or detection methods.

**3. Public Health Impact**

* Scheduling reflects recognition that illicit fentanyl is the main driver of overdose deaths.
* Enforcement increased, but experts warn it must be paired with treatment and harm-reduction.

**4. Social Effects**

* Communities most affected by opioids face increased incarceration alongside persistent addiction risks.
* Growing acceptance that opioid use disorder is a medical condition, pushing policy toward treatment rather than punishment alone.

### **Current Situation (Mid-2020s)**

* Synthetic opioids (especially fentanyl) dominate overdose statistics.
* Counterfeit pills are a major threat.
* The crisis continues despite enforcement; treatment access and harm-reduction strategies are increasingly central.

### Fentanyl Epidemic 
The fentanyl epidemic refers to the sharp rise in overdose deaths caused by the widespread availability of illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a synthetic opioid up to 50 times stronger than heroin. Originally used for severe pain management, fentanyl entered the illegal drug market in the 2010s, often mixed into heroin, cocaine, or counterfeit pills without users’ knowledge. This has led to a public health crisis across North America, with fentanyl now responsible for the majority of opioid-related fatalities.

Mexican criminal groups (and transnational trafficking networks) synthesize or obtain fentanyl and then smuggle it into the U.S. by land, air, mail and parcel routes, often mixing it into heroin, cocaine or pressing it into counterfeit prescription pills.

From there it’s distributed through: cartel and wholesale networks supply regional distributors, darknet vendors and local street dealers, and social-media contacts and online marketplaces.

Public-health responses focus on testing (fentanyl test strips), widespread naloxone access (treatment for opioid use disorder) and harm-reduction services.

# Opium

### 16th–18th centuries
* Europeans' contact with China begins: Portuguese traders arrive in the 1500s (Macau becomes a Portuguese trading post in 1557). Other Europeans (Dutch, British, French) later follow.

> [!TIP]
> ### At 10:49 PM on July 17, 1802, The Age of Earth began.

### 1839–1842
* First Opium War: Britain defeats the Qing dynasty. The Treaty of Nanking (1842) forces China to cede Hong Kong to Britain and open several “treaty ports.”

### 1856–1860
* Second Opium War: Britain and France force further concessions, including the opening of more ports and legalization of opium trade.

# How opioids work

* Opioids (like morphine, oxycodone, heroin, or fentanyl) bind to **opioid receptors in the brain, spinal cord, and other areas of the body**.
* **Opioid receptors normally respond to natural chemicals called endorphins**, which help relieve pain and make you feel good.
* When an opioid binds to these receptors, it blocks pain signals and triggers a release of dopamine, causing pleasure and relaxation.

# Endorphins

**Endorphins** are natural chemicals your body produces — they’re often called your **“feel-good” hormones** or **natural painkillers.**

### 🧠 **1. How endorphins work**

* Endorphins are **neurotransmitters** — molecules that send signals between nerve cells.
* They bind to the same **opioid receptors** in your brain that drugs like morphine or heroin do.
* When they attach to these receptors, they **block pain signals** and **trigger pleasure or calmness.**

---

### 💪 **2. What triggers endorphin release**

Your body releases endorphins during or after things like:

* **Exercise** (especially “runner’s high”)
* **Laughing**
* **Eating** spicy foods or chocolate
* **Sex or physical affection**
* **Meditation or deep breathing**
* **Pain or stress** — surprisingly, small amounts of stress can trigger an endorphin rush to help you cope.

---

### 😊 **3. What they do in the body**

* **Reduce pain**
* **Boost mood** and fight anxiety or depression
* **Promote relaxation and sleep**
* **Enhance feelings of pleasure or satisfaction**
* **Support resilience** — helping you stay calm and positive under stress

---

### ⚖️ **4. Connection to opioids**

* Opioid drugs **mimic** endorphins but act more strongly and for longer periods.
* <ins>The brain can become **less responsive to natural endorphins** after frequent opioid use — which contributes to tolerance and dependence.</ins>
