<h3>HDL Cholesterol</h3>

HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol helps remove excess cholesterol from the bloodstream and transport it to the liver for excretion or recycling. This process helps protect against plaque buildup in arteries, reducing the risk of heart disease and stroke.

<h3>Triglycerides</h3>

Triglycerides are a type of fat that store unused calories and provide energy for the body between meals. High levels of triglycerides can contribute to hardening of the arteries and increase the risk of heart disease and pancreatitis.
<br/><br/>
High blood levels of triglycerides may be caused by overweight/obesity, a diet very high in carbohydrates, physical inactivity, cigarette smoking, and too much alcohol intake. A person may reduce their blood level of triglycerides by controlling their weight, being physically active, not smoking cigarettes, avoiding too much alcohol intake, and limiting their eating and drinking of simple sugars and sugar-sweetened beverages. Some medications may also be helpful to reduce triglyceride levels in the blood.

<h1>2. Exercising</h1>

* Aerobic (cardio) activity helps your body use fats for energy and increases HDL cholesterol.
* 150–300 minutes per week (Average 21.4 - 42.9 minutes per day) of moderate activity

| Time | Activity | Goal |
| -- | -- | -- |
| **After lunch** (10 min) | Light walking | Improves triglyceride levels and insulin sensitivity. 🔽 LDL and 🔼 HDL |
| **After dinner** (20 min) | Light walking | Improves triglyceride levels and insulin sensitivity. 🔽 LDL and 🔼 HDL |

<h2>How light exercise after a meal helps:</h2>

* **Improves digestion:** Gentle movement <ins>increases blood flow to your digestive organs</ins>, helping your stomach and intestines process food more efficiently. It stimulates peristalsis (the wave-like contractions that move food through your digestive tract), reducing bloating and discomfort.

* **Regulates blood sugar levels:** After eating, your blood glucose naturally rises. Light activity helps your muscles absorb glucose from your bloodstream for energy, which <ins>lowers post-meal blood sugar spikes</ins>. This is especially beneficial for people with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

* **Supports heart health:** <ins>Keeping post-meal blood sugar and fat levels stable</ins> reduces stress on your cardiovascular system over time.

* **Boosts metabolism:** Even light exercise <ins>increases metabolic rate slightly</ins>, which can help with calorie balance and weight management.

* **Reduces fatigue and sluggishness:** Movement helps counteract the common “post-meal slump” by <ins>increasing circulation and oxygen delivery to tissues and the brain</ins>.

* **Improves mood:** Light physical activity <ins>triggers the release of endorphins and serotonin, improving mood and reducing stress</ins>.
